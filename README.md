# Roblox-Username-Generator
Roblox Username Generator in C#  This checks for if a Roblox username is taken, if it is not it will then write the username to a file.  (Note there are no 4 letter usernames left)  This is not perfect as the first time you run it you will have to press start once you know how many characters you want then restart. (It does this because of the fact it can't write to the file once it first starts, working on a solution)!  This also shows banned names that you can't use but their Roblox account is banned.  Cheers and have fun!
